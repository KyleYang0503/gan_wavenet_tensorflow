# Gan_Wavenet_Tensorflow
## Introduction
Project for the competition:

玉山人工智慧公開挑戰賽(Credit card consumption category recommendation)

Objective: 

To test the possibility of successful application of GAN in recommender systems

Model's Purpose : Find regularities in a one-dimensional sequence of dat and predict

Result:Top 30%


## Data
The data of this competition already has a series of consumption records and to future consumption

Ex.
Tpye:[2,5,2,6,8,3.....] a series of list

you can replace to any other one dimensional data

## Output

Use generater.py to generate any length output as you like

(Accuracy decreases with output length)
